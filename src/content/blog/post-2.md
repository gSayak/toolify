Bard was unveiled on February 6 in a statement from Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Even though Bard was an entirely new concept, the AI chat service that was launched was powered by Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA), which was unveiled two years prior. Google Bard was then released a little over a month later on March 21, 2023. 

Google Bard is now powered by Google's very own and most advanced large language model (LLM) PaLM 2, which was unveiled at Google I/O 2023.
PaLM 2 -- a more advanced version of PaLM, which was released in April 2022 -- will allow Bard to be much more efficient and to perform at a higher level.
